The issue with the current code might lie in the choice of hyperparameters for the Adam optimizer and the training process itself. Here are some suggestions for improving the training speed and potentially achieving better reconstruction results:
1. Hyperparameter Tuning:
 * Learning Rate: The initial learning rate might be too high. Try starting with a smaller value (e.g., 0.00001) and adjust it based on the validation loss. Consider using a learning rate scheduler like Cosine Annealing with Restarts for a more gradual decrease.
 * Batch Size: Experiment with different batch sizes. A larger batch size can improve training speed but might lead to worse convergence. A smaller batch size can be slower but might offer better fine-tuning.
 * Beta values: The default values for beta1 (0.9) and beta2 (0.999) are often a good starting point, but you can try slightly different values (e.g., beta1=0.8, beta2=0.99) to see if it helps.
 * L2 Regularization: The current L2 regularization term (1e-5) might be too weak. Experiment with slightly larger values (e.g., 1e-4 or 1e-3) to prevent overfitting.
2. Training Procedure:
 * Early Stopping: Implement early stopping to prevent overtraining. This technique monitors the validation loss and stops training when it starts to increase, indicating the model is memorizing the training data and not generalizing well.
 * Data Augmentation: Consider applying data augmentation techniques like random cropping, flipping, or adding noise to the training images. This can help the model learn more robust features and improve generalization.
3. Monitoring Progress:
 * Visualization: Regularly monitor the reconstruction quality during training. Plot a few original images and their corresponding reconstructions after each epoch to visually assess the progress.
 * Validation Loss:  Use a separate validation set to track the model's performance on unseen data. Monitor the validation loss to ensure the model is not overfitting to the training data.
4. Network Architecture:
 * Hidden Layer Size: While a hidden size of 256 is common, you can experiment with different sizes to see if it affects the training speed or reconstruction quality.
Trying these suggestions might lead to faster training and potentially better results. Remember, it's crucial to experiment and find the optimal hyperparameter combination for your specific dataset and network architecture.
