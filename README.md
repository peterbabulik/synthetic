1. Sierpinski.ipynb:
   Sierpinski triangle (1/n^, hard to compute)

2. 1_n+1_growth.ipynb:
   Spiral-like fractal (1/n+1, easy to compute)

3. Nested.ipynb:
   Synthetic AI (randomly generated parameters) teaching itself to encode/decode data, storing itself in a fractal structure

4. Entropy595.ipynb:
   Investigation of the consistent 5.95 bit entropy phenomenon observed in the encoding system

5. Exponential_Canopy_Fractal.ipynb:
   Exploration of a fractal structure with exponential growth, possibly forming a canopy-like shape

6. Logarithmic.ipynb:
   Study of fractal structures with logarithmic growth patterns

7. Multi Level Nesting.ipynb:
   Examination of fractal structures with multiple levels of nested patterns, potentially a more complex version of Nested.ipynb

8. Nested_Canopy_Fractal1.ipynb:
   Combination of nested structures and canopy-like fractals, possibly merging concepts from Nested.ipynb and Exponential_Canopy_Fractal.ipynb

9. colab.ipynb:
